Description: After the successful mission of Space Pirate, Bonnie ordered Ramona to hijack another spaceship on her own on a stealth mission. She managed to get inside it and had limited access to the central controller. By reverse-engineering the controller, we figured out that it uses a unique set of VM instructions with limited capabilities. Can you help her break out of this VM and gain unlimited access?
