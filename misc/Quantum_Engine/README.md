Description: We need to travel to one of Draeger's lair in a galaxy far away from here, to search for any clues that might help us prove how Draeger manipulated her to be his most trustworthy cold-blooded assassin. However, traveling there can be quite difficult since it's flooded with the most state-of-the-art IFGs attack spacecrafts. Should we be able to outspeed them, we might have a chance of making it there in one piece. That is why we came to you. Word on the solar system is that you are one of the best quantum mechanics of the galaxy, which I find odd considering your age. Will you be able to modify Phalcon's acceleration system so no IFG spacecraft can ever catch us?
