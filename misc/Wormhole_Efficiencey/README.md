Description: After a severe clash with one of Golden Fang's battleships, Ramona's spaceship was damaged, and now it consumes fuel at the triple cost. Can you reach home without running out of fuel? Our best option is to travel through wormholes otherwise, the spaceship will be left wandering in space and become prey to Golden Fang's army.
