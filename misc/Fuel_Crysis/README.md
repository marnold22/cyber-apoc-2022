Description: After travelling for too many light years, we managed to reach an uninhabited planet to rest for a while. We got a problem though. Phalcon is running out of fuel and we need to stop at the nearest space station to refuel. The closest one is the B1-4S3D station, where we are unfortunately banned from docking our ship. Our surveillance showed that the station uses two OCR cameras to read the unique ID of each spaceship entering. The first one is used as a validator for the second one. We've managed to find a way to disable the validation process for a split second while our ship passes, but we still need to pass through the second camera. Furthermore, our lead hacker opened a connection with the second camera, which we can use to upload our custom model weights. Try to find a way to change the predictions of the model when we pass through the second gate. Be careful though, the other four spaceships that are in front of us need to be ID'd correctly so no suspicion raises.
