Description: In one of Bonnie's first missions, a helpless dog was injured by the laser guns during the fierce fight and was unable to move and escape the war scene. Bonnie took the dog and fled the battle, but not much he could do to help the poor dog. Some of the crew's doctors and engineers, made some mutations and added artificial parts to the dog, making it a living war machine under Bonnie's control. After the last fight, something hit the manufactured parts, making them malfunction and driving the dog berserk. Can you fix them and make the dog loyal under Bonnie's control again?
