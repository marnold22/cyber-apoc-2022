Description: Reading through an Underground Intergalactic hacking forum Bonnie stumbles upon a post talking about a backdoor in the Gold Fang’s Spaceship Fleet Management System. There is a note about a twist added by the author to prevent anyone from using the backdoor. Will Bonnie achieve to gain access to Gold Fang’s internal network and retrieve precious documents?
