Description: The previous attempts to get access to the financial operator's account of the Golden Fang army failed, and the Genesis platform went under heavy security modifications to patch any potential issues it might have. Luckily, the operator's credentials remained the same icarus:FlyHighToTheSky. Can you bypass the 2FA protection and hack into the wallet account of that operator to drain his balance?
