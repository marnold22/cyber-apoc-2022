Description: The Red Island of the glowing sea is a proud tribe of species that can only see red colors. Hence every physical item, picture, and poster on this island is masked with red colors. The Golden Fang army took advantage of the color weakness of the species of Red Island to smuggle illegal goods in and out of the island behind the ministry's back. Without an invitation, it's impossible to get entry to the island. So we need to hack the ministry and send us an invite from the inside to stop the atrocities of Draeger's men on this island. As always, Ulysses, with his excellent recon skills, got us access to one of the portals of the Red Island ministry. Can you gain access to their networks through this portal?
