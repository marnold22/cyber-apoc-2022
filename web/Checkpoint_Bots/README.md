Description: The evergreen Earth was seized by the nomadic tribes of the Glowing Sea during the energy crisis war that turned beautiful Japan into a war-torn autonomous region of militarized activities. Even after Draeger's defeat, the once proud nation of Japan was still under the captivity of the nomadic tribes and is currently at war with other regions. At the request of the Earth liberation front, Ulysses and the crew decided to help infiltrate their headquarters in the Kyoto region. Can you disarm the Checkpoint bots that roam around the city of Kyoto?
