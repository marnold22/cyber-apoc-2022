Description: Captain Spiky comes from a rare species of creatures who can only breathe underwater. During the energy-crisis war, he was captured as a war prisoner and later forced to be a Tamagotchi pet for a child of a general of nomadic tribes. He is forced to react in specific ways and controlled remotely purely for the amusement of the general's children. The Paraman crew needs to save the captain of his misery as he is potentially a great asset for the war against Draeger. Can you hack into the Tamagotchi controller to rescue the captain?
