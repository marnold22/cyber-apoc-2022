Description: Years have passed since Miyuki rescued you from the graveyard. When Virgil tells you that he needs your help with something he found there, desperate thoughts about your father and the disabilities you developed due to the disposal process come to mind. The device looks like an advanced GPS with AI capabilities. Riddled with questions about the past, you are pessimistic that you could be of any value. After hours of fiddling and observing the power traces of this strange device, you and Virgil manage to connect to the debugging interface and write an interpreter to control the signals. The protocol looks familiar to you. Your father always talked about implementing this scheme in devices for security reasons. Could it have been him?

## NOTES

CREDIT TO: willwam845 for the help
Weâ€™re given access to a server which implements the Diffe-Hellman Key Exchange protocol.
The server sends us the Diffe-Hellman parameters g,p, and generates a private key c and its corresponding public key C=gcmodp. We are then allowed to send a public key M, from which the shared secret is derived as Mcmodp. Our goal is to recover the shared secret, from which we can send the server a message which will get us the flag.

We have free choice over M, and we would like to make it so that for any c, we know the value of Mc, as this is the shared secret.
Since 1 to the power of anything is 1, we can set M=1, and then we know the shared secret will always be 1.
After this, we can use the shared secret to encrypt the chosen message, and recover the flag.
