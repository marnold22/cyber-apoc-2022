Description: Intergalactic Federation stated that it managed to prevent a large-scale phishing campaign that targeted all space personnel across the galaxy. The enemy's goal was to add as many spaceships to their space-botnet as possible so they can conduct distributed destruction of intergalactic services (DDOIS) using their fleet. Since such a campaign can be easily detected and prevented, malicious actors have changed their tactics. As stated by officials, a new spear phishing campaign is underway aiming high value targets. Now Klaus asks your opinion about a mail it received from sales@unlockyourmind.gal, claiming that in their galaxy it is possible to recover it's memory back by following the steps contained in the attached file.
