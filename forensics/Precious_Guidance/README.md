Description: Miyuki has come across what seems to be a suspicious process running on one of her spaceship's navigation systems. After investigating the origin of this process, it seems to have been initiated by a script called SatelliteGuidance.vbs. Eventually, one of your engineers informs her that she found this file in the spaceship's Intergalactic Inbox and thought it was an interactive guide for the ship's satellite operations. She tried to run the file but nothing happened. You and Miyuki start analysing it and notice you don't understand its code... it is obfuscated! What could it be and who could be behind its creation? Use your skills to uncover the truth behind the obfuscation layers.
