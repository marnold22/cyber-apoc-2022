Description: You and Miyuki have succeeded in dis-empowering Draeger's army in every possible way. Stopped their fuel-supply plan, arrested their ransomware gang, prevented massive phishing campaigns and understood their tactics and techniques in depth. Now it is the time for the final blow. The final preparations are completed. Everyone is in their stations waiting for the signal. This mission can only be successful if you use the element of surprise. Thus, the signal must remain a secret until the end of the operation. During some last-minute checks you notice some weird behaviour in Miyuki's PC. You must find out if someone managed to gain access to her PC before it's too late. If so, the signal must change. Time is limited and there is no room for errors.
