Description: After Ramona helped Virgil escape from the prison they were holding him they had to find a way to flee the planet but all the spaceships were grounded. Luckily they manage to gain access to a hangar with decommissioned escape pods. After some tinkering with the pod's control panel, they managed to attach some probes to it and reverse engineer the proprietary protection circuit but some of it appears to be damaged. The only thing holding them back was finding a way to gain access to the flight control system.
