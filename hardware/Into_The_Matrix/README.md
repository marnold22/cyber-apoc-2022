Description: After a long time away it is finally time to get back all the equipment build all those years. While going through the hardware devices to reconfigure or upgrade them one of them seemed a bit off. It appears that someone was toying with a few of the devices, changing and breaking the hard-wired components which resulted in some of them malfunctioning. The status matrix in one of the armor-enhancing weapons seems to display random indications making the weapon selection system unusable. This, combined with the fact that most of the circuitry is now under a hard epoxy resin makes it impossible to reconfigure the hardware connection, thus the only solution is to reverse engineer the current device layout and add an additional circuitry that will work around the current one.
