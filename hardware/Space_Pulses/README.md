Description: One of our enhanced radio telescopes captured some weird fluctuations from a nearby star. It was idle for decades due to the fact that it was fully enclosed by a Dyson Sphere but its patterns began to change drastically leading us to believe that someone is controlling part of the megastructure to release energy and send these pulses directed to us in order to transmit a message. They must have known that our equipment can read even the slightest flactuations.
