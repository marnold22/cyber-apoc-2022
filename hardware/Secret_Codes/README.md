# Secret_Codes

## FLAG: HTB{}

## Status: Incomplete

+ DOCKER: NO
+ DOWNLOADABLE: YES

Description: A sudden burst of RF signals started in an attempt to compromise our perimeter security. We intercepted a few of them but our ADC broke during the transformation to a serial signal leaving us with only an analog capture. We need to decode it and find if they are close to finding the correct passcode.
