Rohendel was a planet of peace and prosperity, responsible for many technological advancements that made space colonization possible in the Nim cluster. Paulie, since a child, was fascinated and studied the ancient civilizations of his planet on this subject. The elemental stones, necessary for warp-speed transportation fuel, can only be harvested there. Wanting to get these resources for himself, Draeger ordered an attack on Rohendel that decimated its population, leaving only Paulie alive. He was kept as a pet by one of the death squad commanders and grew up in the harsh conditions of a mercenary ship. He used his talent to decipher the alien language and technology. One day when everyone was sleeping, he managed to escape the station through an escape pod. Once out in the vastly empty space, the pod malfunctioned and sent a distress signal to nearby vessels, where he was left there deserted for days. Paulie was running out of hope until the Paraman crew eventually found him and took him in.
