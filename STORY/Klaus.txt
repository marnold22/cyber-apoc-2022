Klaus was designed as a peacekeeper prototype for the crime-riddled area of Mirthidelle. His creator, Danbeer, loved and raised him as his child since he could not bear his own due to the prolonged exposure to the polluted air in the underground city. Once the council of Longhir learned of the successful prototype-making, they ordered his destruction, and he was later transferred to another galaxy on a planet designated for the disposal of androids. In the waste factory, he managed to escape but not before the factory workers encrypted parts of its memory during the hard-reset process. Klaus was unable to get out of the android graveyard area of the factory since the right portion of his body was paralyzed because the encryption reached some of its movement function routines. This was when he met Miyuki, who entered the disposal dump to search for parts to repair her spaceship. She was fascinated by his capabilities and reasoning and took him into their Paraman crew. Klaus now vows to break the encryption someday that holds his original location's memories and reunite with his Father.
