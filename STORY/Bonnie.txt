Bonnie grew up poor and an orphan. He resorted to crime after a local mob boss saw promise in him and undertook him as a disciple. Bonnie started as a debt collector and enforcer and quickly moved up in the ranks, becoming head of connections. He was in charge of transporting the illegal exploits sold in the black market of the city, a trade he had been interested in since he was young. After a couple of years, the mob wasn't doing well since a council reform imposed a crackdown on crime. Growing paranoid of a potential mutiny, the mob boss ordered a hit on critical members of his gang. Bonnie survived an unsuccessful hitjob that left him a scar in the process. He then went after the mob boss, whom he thought of as a father, ultimately taking his place. In a constant cycle of violence that didn't let Bonnie retire from the ways he grew apart and hated, Miyuki, that was after him all this time, offered a lifeline. In exchange for helping her take down Draeger, a clean slate and a new life.
