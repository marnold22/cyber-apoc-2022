Ramona was a model student in school, she was top of the class in mathematics and science, and she was also competing from an early age in gymnastics with great success. An accident gave her a limp and forced her to quit sports.As a result she gave all her focus on her academic career. Her research on bioinjectable implants caught a lot of attention, and got her a position on Longhir’s research division, where she met her husband, Virgil. Ramona shared the same vision of helping people with Virgil and helped him create the exoskeleton suit that he used for helping people after the crisis began. After hearing of Virgil’s arrest, Ramona was devastated. After the first days of shock, she decided that Virgil’s attitude of wanting to help everyone was not suitable for this world. She used the same technology that Virgil used for his suit to fix her leg and enhance her body. But instead of being designed to help people, the enhancements were geared towards extermination. One night she infiltrated the prison, moving in the shadows and taking out and disposing almost any guard that came her way. When the prison staff realised the intrusion it was too late. Virgli took some time to recognise his wife under the heavy modification. Two similar people, using the same technology for different reasons. They had no other choice but to flee the planet after being declared Longhir’s most wanted criminals. They hopped planets, while taking contracts for a living. During this time, they took a job from Bonnie that went so good that they were offered a spot on the crew.
