Virgil was born out of wedlock by a noblewoman from an oligarch family operating within Longhir's council. Once informed of her recent childbirth, the king ordered the child's execution to avoid bringing disgrace to the royal bloodline. The soldier took pity on the helpless child and decided to give him up in an orphanage, concealing his existence from the king. Virgil's engineering ingenuity allowed him to be selected and join the Daskayano project for gifted children at a young age. Growing up in a highly competitive environment, his fellow students often bullied Virgil since he was the only orphan and was often caught carrying improvised lab equipment made of scraps. The project coordinator, Meiro, witnessed Virgil's potential and decided to sponsor his formal education. During his academic years, he wasn't interested in making friends and always kept on himself focusing on his studies. After graduating, he joined Longhir's research division and worked alongside his sponsor. That's where he met his wife, Ramona, who worked as a chemical engineer in the department. After many years of working alongside Meiro and Ramona, they accomplished significant neuro-linked body modification technology advancements. Recent political turmoil drove the once humanitarian project research scope into military technology. Virgil took it upon himself to help as many people as possible. He created a suit that was working both as an armour and as an exoskeleton significantly improving his strength and speed. Virgil was often seen running towards explosions instead of running away, pulling people away from the rabble. His choice of not taking sides were disliked by the king and his rivals alike, and they organised his kidnapping, when he was locked away for months and being tortured, until Ramona came to the rescue. Together they had to flee the planet. While running away, they met the Paraman crew and decided to join forces.
