The founding member and leader of the group, Miyuki, served as a foreign intelligence officer during the Nim cluster cold war. She was the youngest cadet graduate that passed with high honors in Vinyr's recorded history. Her incredible investigative skills and natural intuition allowed her to move up the ranks quickly. During the Vinyr-Longhir proxy wars, she was appointed as an ambassador based on Urkir, a planet that declared neutrality. Once the Mutants invaded Rohendel, the Galactic Federation issued an embargo on intergalactic arms deals. She later became the investigative lead on sanctions breaks and uncovered Longhir's involvement in the constant supply of arms passing through The Glowing Sea. Before reporting this back to the station, Draeger's spies abducted her and her family during the final negotiations of the Vinyr-Mutant conflict. During their captivity in a general's bunker, her family was used as a bargaining chip to prevent further troop movements and call for an end to the siege. When Ulysses found out about Miyuki's abduction, he abandoned his station and went to save her. After taking down the guards, he attempted to gain access and open the bunker door. The door mechanism was booby-trapped, which resulted in the bunker being blown up and collapsing in on itself. In the rubbles, it was later discovered that Miyuki was the only survivor. Suffering from memory loss, she woke up from a medically induced coma that lasted almost a yearâ€”eventually learning about her family's fate and Draeger's escape. Having nothing left to live for, she took off in the vast empty space, planning her revenge.
