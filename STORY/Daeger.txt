Thoccarth was once a place of wondrous experimentation, vibrant and colorful life where anything could be achieved, but not without a cost. A couple of millennia ago, continuous political turmoil and endless games of power led to a nuclear civil war that turned the once beautiful Thoccarth into a radioactive wasteland. A parasitic species of Mutants landed on the planet through a meteorite and managed to survive and thrive on the decimated land. In a war-torn world of savages, little to none is known about how Draeger came to power and united many of the nomadic tribes of The Glowing Sea. After being proclaimed the universal ruler of the Mutants, he led the defense of his home planet in the energy crisis war. Ulysses's militarised planet, Vinyr, proved to be better prepared and equipped. Draeger kidnapped Miyuki and her family as a bargaining chip in a desperate attempt. After feeling betrayed by the final negotiations of the Vinyr-Mutant conflict, he unsuccessfully led the last stand that left his home planet destroyed and Miyuki's family killed. Draeger was later taken into custody for crimes against sentient life. After managing to escape the maximum-security black hole, he migrated to another galaxy, searching for an army to lead. Draeger again rose into power with false promises of providing boundless riches and resources by influencing and manipulating Longhir's planet's council. Having direct access to the planet's vault, he eventually bought the Golden Fang mercenary army, which he plans to overtake the cluster with.
