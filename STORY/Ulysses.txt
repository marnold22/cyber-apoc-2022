Vinyr was the first planet to perceive the dying sun's threat to their existence. A couple of generations before, the state took drastic measures to assure its survival in a potential all-out war. The state-backed 'Ikarus' project pioneered the research of nuclear arsenal development and conventional military deployment. During the cold war, they issued a mandated enlistment of any person of age. Ulysses grew up in a strict environment and was under significant pressure from his father to follow in his footsteps and join the army as a corporal. The people on his planet lived under constant alert and fear since the galaxy had declared open combat due to the sun dying. Ulysses found great comfort in such dreadful times with his childhood friend Miyuki, who was his first and only love. In the great Energy Crisis war, his home planet emerged victorious with the cost of entire civilizations being destroyed. As a commander of his own battleship battalion that led the attack on The Glowing Sea, he witnessed destruction, genocides, and the lives of his beloved friends being taken away from him. He regrets being part of the military and hasn't been himself since. He lives in constant torment for not being able to save Miyuki's family. Bonnie approached him for help due to his military experience. He has since reconciled with Miyuki and is now working with her to take down Draeger.
